Hi! I'm Jeremy.

Professionally, I'm an Instructional Technologist with Academic Technology for
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University. I do a variety of
things to support digital scholarship within the university, but I think of my
work as having two main prongs: using computational methods to ask new
questions, and using digital tools to disseminate ideas. The work takes
different forms at different times, but that's the description of it that
should last.

Personally, I'm a speculative fiction fan who's trying to be a constantly
improving person, with mixed success.
