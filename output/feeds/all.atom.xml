&lt;p&gt;I set up this repository with &lt;code&gt;pelican-quickstart&lt;/code&gt;, and since I knew I wanted to use github pages, I set up my repository as well, so I could set the base url to &lt;code&gt;https://jaguillette.github.io/pelican-test&lt;/code&gt; from the jump. I also configured the automation to be set up for deploying to github pages, just following the prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I ran &lt;code&gt;pelican content&lt;/code&gt; to generate the site, it failed and said it couldn't find any files it recognized, but didn't list markdown as something it was looking for, so I ran &lt;code&gt;pip install markdown&lt;/code&gt;. After that &lt;code&gt;pelican content&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pelican --listen&lt;/code&gt; were both happy to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a look at the &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt; to see what kinds of options I have. I saw &lt;code&gt;make publish&lt;/code&gt;, but that looks like it'll just generate with production settings. &lt;code&gt;make github&lt;/code&gt; looked like the ticket, but at first it complained because I didn't have &lt;code&gt;ghp-import&lt;/code&gt; (GitHub pages import). Then it complained because I forgot to initialize the repo. I did that and added the remote origin, then ran &lt;code&gt;make github&lt;/code&gt; again. That pushed a &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch to the repo, which happened to be the first branch. That just has the site content. I set up my &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt;, then pushed the main code to &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;, which I had to make the default branch since &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; was there first. The repo was already set up to deploy though, and looks to work.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry></feed>
