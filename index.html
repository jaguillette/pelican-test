</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Since this is a blog generator, might as well test it with documenting the process of setting it up. I'm set up in a fresh python virtual environment, and so far I've installed the following packages as they've come up:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pelican
markdown
ghp-import
</code></pre></div>

<p>I set up this repository with <code>pelican-quickstart</code>, and since I knew I wanted to use github pages, I set up my repository as well, so I could set the base url to <code>https://jaguillette.github.io/pelican-test</code> from the jump. I also configured the automation to be set up for deploying to github pages, just following the prompts.</p>
<p>The first time I ran <code>pelican content</code> to generate the site, it failed and said it couldn't find any files it recognized, but didn't list markdown as something it was looking for, so I ran <code>pip install markdown</code>. After that <code>pelican content</code> and <code>pelican --listen</code> were both happy to run.</p>
<p>I took a look at the <code>Makefile</code> to see what kinds of options I have. I saw <code>make publish</code>, but that looks like it'll just generate with production settings. <code>make github</code> looked like the ticket, but at first it complained because I didn't have <code>ghp-import</code> (GitHub pages import). Then it complained because I forgot to initialize the repo. I did that and added the remote origin, then ran <code>make github</code> again. That pushed a <code>gh-pages</code> branch to the repo, which happened to be the first branch. That just has the site content. I set up my <code>.gitignore</code>, then pushed the main code to <code>main</code>, which I had to make the default branch since <code>gh-pages</code> was there first. The repo was already set up to deploy though, and looks to work.</p>                </article>
